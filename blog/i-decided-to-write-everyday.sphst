After my finals ended I decided focus on my personal brand to create a community who love my work and want to see my work continue. After years what I learned from people who created unbreakable products & things is, **consistency & patience**. In order to make it happen I'll start to post on my blog every day. They all will not about programming. I'm planning to write about design, business, life maybe space... That's why it's called personal blog 🙂
