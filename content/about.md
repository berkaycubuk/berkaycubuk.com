My name is Berkay Çubuk. I program and develop things that work on servers, websites and even on your computer. Also, I live and work in Bursa, Turkey.

Currently I am studying at the [Bursa Uludağ University](https://uludag.edu.tr), maintaining [open-source](https://github.com/berkaycubuk) projects and solving problems.

I developed e-commerce and landing page sites for my clients, experimented with social media websites and mobile apps. Now looking forward to work on other great projects and experiment with other languages.
