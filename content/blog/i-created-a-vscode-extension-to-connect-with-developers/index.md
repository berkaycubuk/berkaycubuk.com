Yesterday, I released my most complicated extension to the VsCode marketplace. The core concept of **Codemate** is connecting with developers.

## What is used to create Codemate?

In VsCode to create a extension you have to use Javascript so I used Typescript to create the extension. But, to make the development simpler I also used [Svelte ](https://svelte.dev/)to create user interfaces.

For the backend, I continued with Javscript so I created it with also Typescript. To store data I used most preferred choice, MongoDB.

Extension:

- Typescript
- Svelte

Backend / API:

- Typescript
- Express.js
- Github OAuth
- MongoDB

## What are the features?

I tried to keep it simple. Right now you can,

- customize your profile (don't forget to pick a programming language)
- connect with other people
- login with Github (it's more secure)
- completely[ open source](https://github.com/berkaycubuk/codemate)
