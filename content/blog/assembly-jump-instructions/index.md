With jump instructions we can control the program flow. There are different types of jumps:

### Unconditional jumps

With `JMP` command we can move to another point in the program.
```asm
JMP label   ;syntax of JMP instruction
```

In order to run jump instruction we should have a label. Labels are simple checkpoints to describe it to computer. We can simply declare label with adding **":"** to the end. Like other languages we cannot start with a number. Here are examples for labels:
```asm
label1: MOV AX, 1
label2: MOV AX, 2
```

Now we can try what we learned on example:
```asm
.MODEL SMALL

.STACK 64

.CODE
  MOV AX, 5               ;set AX to 5
  MOV BX, 2               ;set BX to 2

  JMP label1              ;go to label1

  label2: JMP label3      ;go to label3

  label1:
  ADD AX, BX              ;add BX to AX and store it in AX
  JMP label2              ;go to label2

  label3:
  MOV AX, 4C00H           ;terminate
  INT 21H

END                       ;exit
```

### Short Conditional Jumps

With `JMP` instruction we can do unconditional jump but sometimes we only want to jump when some conditions are in act. To make it happen we have 3 different groups of other instructions.

#### Jump instructions that test single flag
InstructionDescriptionConditionJZ, JEJump if zero (equal)ZF = 1JC, JB, JNAEJump if carry (below, not above equal)CF = 1JSJump if signSF =1JOJump if overflowOF = 1JPE, JPJump if parity evenPF = 1
All instructions have their opposites. Like `JZ` (Jump if zero) with `JNZ` (Jump if not zero). Also some instructions do the same thing like `JZ` (Jump if zero) and `JE` (Jump if equal).

#### Jump instructions for signed numbers
InstructionDescriptionConditionJE, JZJump if equal (zero)ZF = 1JG, JNLEJump if greater (not less or equal)ZF = 0 and SF = OFJL, JNGEJump if less (not greater or equal)SF <> OFJGE, JNLJump if greater or eqaul (not less)SF = OFJLE, JNGJump if less or equal (not greater)ZF = 1 or SF <> OF
*<> is means not equal, in other words !=*

#### Jump instructions for unsigned numbers
InstructionDescriptionConditionJE, JZJump if equal (zero)ZF = 1JA, JNBEJump if above (not below or equal)CF = 0 and ZF = 0JB, JNAE, JCJump if below (not above or equal, carry)CF = 1JAE, JNB, JNCJump if above or equal (not below, not carry)CF = 0JBE, JNAJump if below or equal (not above)CF = 1 or ZF = 1
Ok, that's look complicated. I want to give you an example to make it understandable.
```asm
.MODEL SMALL

.STACK 64

.CODE
  MOV AL, 25
  MOV BL, 10
  CMP AL, BL      ;compare AL with BL (I'll explain it later...)
  JE equal        ;if AL = BL, go to equal label
  MOV CL, "N"     ;if it's run here that means AL <> BL
  JMP stop        ;go to stop and move 'N' to CL

  equal:          ;if it's come here
  MOV CL, "Y"     ;move 'Y' to CL

  stop:
  MOV AH, 02H     ;set interrupt
  MOV DL, CL      ;set interrupt message
  INT 21H

  MOV AX, 4C00H   ;terminate
  INT 21H

END               ;exit
```

With this program we can compare 2 integers and tell the user are they equal or not. If you look carefully you'll see `CMP` command, it's comparing 2 integers. If they are equal we move the flow to equal label, if not we are not changing the flow.
