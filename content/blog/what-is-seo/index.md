To understand it better we have to know how websites are created. They're created with code, million lines of code! For a normal person, code is just big chunk of words & symbols. For search engines it different, it's information to display on your browser.

It's important to make the code clear & easy to understand for search engines. That's where we start to talk SEO. 

Ok, you made it magical, now give me an example:

    <meta name="description" content="Meta Description" />
