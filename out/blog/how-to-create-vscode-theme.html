<h1>How to Create VsCode Theme</h1>
<p>date 20.12.2020</p>
<p>VS Code is popular code editor around developers. It has it's own marketplace so, you can easly customize your editor.</p>
<p>Recently I developed my first VS Code theme and extension. I want to share with you how I did and how you can build your own.</p>
<h2>What is theme?</h2>
<p>Themes are simply customized color palettes for editors. They define colors in json file so, you can download and use it on your editor.</p>
<h2>What is required to get started?</h2>
<p>- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> - <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a></p>
<p>If you installed these programs, we can move to installing required packages.</p>
<p>We have to install some packages to start with theme boilerplate.</p>
<p>npm i -g yo generator-code</p>
<p>Now we have VS Code extension generator. To start developing, run:</p>
<p>yo code</p>
<p>After running it, you should see something like this:</p>
<img src="/images/how-to-create-vscode-theme/yo-code-screenshot-1.png" alt="yo-code-screenshot-1" />
<p>Select **New Color Theme** and hit enter.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we build our theme from scratch so, pick **No, start fresh**</p>
<img src="/images/how-to-create-vscode-theme/yo-code-screenshot-2.png" alt="yo-code-screenshot-2" />
<p>Answer the questions:</p>
<img src="/images/how-to-create-vscode-theme/yo-code-screenshot-3.png" alt="yo-code-screenshot-3" />
<p>Now yeoman should create a new folder named as your theme name.</p>
<p>Open your theme folder with VS Code to get started.</p>
<p>You should see this:</p>
<img src="/images/how-to-create-vscode-theme/screenshot-4.png" alt="screenshot-4" />
<p>Your will work with json file to edit theme.</p>
<p>In the **colors** you can edit background, foreground and active colors. Just type something you want and it'll autofill for you.</p>
<p>Inside the **tokenColors** as you can guess we'll work with syntax highlighting. You can edit colors for general or specific languages.</p>
<p>Please take a look at the default code to understand it better.</p>
<h2>How to see the theme in real time?</h2>
<p>In VS Code press `f5` to run debug mode. You should see another VS Code with your theme.</p>
<p>When you make changes it'll automaticly update itself.</p>
<h2>How to find token names?</h2>
<p>VS Code give us token viewer tool. To run it type `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for **Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes**.</p>
<p>After, just click the text you want to see. It'll show you what tokens it have.</p>
<img src="/images/how-to-create-vscode-theme/screenshot-5.png" alt="screenshot-5" />
<h2>How to change colors?</h2>
<p>With inspect editor find your token and search it inside theme json file. If you can't find it no worries you can easly add your own token.</p>
<p>For this example I'll go with the public syntax. To find it I'll search for **storage.modifier**. You can also search it specific for php.</p>
<img src="/images/how-to-create-vscode-theme/screenshot-6.png" alt="screenshot-6" />
<p>To change the color just edit **foreground**.</p>
<img src="/images/how-to-create-vscode-theme/screenshot-7.png" alt="screenshot-7" />
<p>As you can see all **storage.modifier** tokens are changed.</p>
<h2>Further more</h2>
<p>VS Code shared articles on their website about publishing your own theme.</p>
