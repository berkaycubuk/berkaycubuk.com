<h1>Introduction to Java</h1>
<p>date 17.11.2020</p>
<h2>What is Java?</h2>
<p>Java is not only programming language, Java is a platform with multiple sub items:</p>
<p>- Programming language - Infrastructure for Java apps - Libraries and tools for different areas like desktop, mobile, watch, web...</p>
<p>Java have 3 different connected platforms:</p>
<p>**Java Standart Edition (JSE)**: Core for basic Java apps.</p>
<p>**Java Enterprise Edition (JEE)**: For big, distributed commercial Java apps.</p>
<p>**Java Micro Edition (JME)**: For small devices like mobile, watch...</p>
<p>To use these platforms, first you have to learn JSE, because other platforms are based on JSE.</p>
<h2>Java is platform independent</h2>
<p>Java is platform independent so you can develop your java application in your current device and use it in any other device.</p>
<p>> Java has "Write once, run anywhere" philosophy.</p>
<p>For example I can create calculator application on my windows machine and then I can use it on my linux machine. That's super cool ðŸ¤¯</p>
<p>But how it's possible? It's simple because java uses **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. First we writing our java application and compiling it with java compiler. After compiling it's produce **class** files with **.class** extension. Class files are contain platform independent byte-code binary data that can be interpreted by any **JVM**. But that means we have JVM's that designed for each platform. This JVM thing lowers our speed but that's the price for independence (Talking about miliseconds ðŸ˜›).</p>
<p>Also we have **JDK** and **JRE**.</p>
<p>**JDK** (Java Development Kit) is what we're using to develop java applications. **JRE** (Java Runtime Enviorement) is what we need to run java applications.</p>
<h2>Let's start programming</h2>
<p>Before start programming you have to setup your enviorement. It's different for each operating system so you can take quick look on the web.</p>
<p>Start with something well known: ```asm public class FirstApp { // also your filename => FirstApp.java</p>
<p>public static void main(String[] args) {  // standart structure for main function // do what you want</p>
<p>System.out.println("Hello World!");  // print string to the console</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>} ```asm</p>
<p>Output will be like: ```asm > Hello World! ```asm</p>
<p>OK, looks cool but how did I compile and run that ðŸ¤” If you want to learn the core concept, open your terminal and run `javac FirstApp.java`. This command will create **FirstApp.class** file. To run the program just type `java FirstApp`. That's how we compile and run java application, but in reality that's not efficent. To make it better we use IDE's. There are good alternatives such as <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij IDEA</a>, <a href="https://netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a>...</p>
