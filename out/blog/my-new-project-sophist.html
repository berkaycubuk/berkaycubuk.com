<p>I worked with lots of static site generators, and now trying to build my own. While doing that I also develop a new language to structure the content. I think this is an advantage compared to other solutions. This language is called Sophist, and it focused on static website building.</p>
<p>You can check out the source of code of this site: <a href="https://github.com/berkaycubuk/berkaycubuk.com">github.com/berkaycubuk/berkaycubuk.com</a></p>
<p>If you want to inspect how it works here is the source code of Sophist: <a href="https://github.com/berkaycubuk/sophist">github.com/berkaycubuk/sophist</a></p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Ordering things and making design decisions from the markdown files is not a solution. So I wanted something that I can freely decide where goes where. This simplicity may come with some drawbacks, but I'm cool with that. Since this is my first language, I'll be happy with something that barely works :^)</p>
<h2>Current progress</h2>
<p>This is not a huge project, and something that people rely on their life. So I'm free to decide what to add. Currently it support headings, images and HTML. It also supports importing, so you can split your parts into multiple .sphst files.</p>
<p>I want to add variables and looping. Also there are missing core features like lists, highlighting and dividers.</p>
