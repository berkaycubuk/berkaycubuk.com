<h1>Bizmovo is updated</h1>

<a href="https://bizmovo.com">Bizmovo</a> is my web development studio and also my test board. I test my ideas on it and re-iterate all the time. Yesterday, I again itereated it into it's core goal, service business. And I'm going to stick with it.

This time I did not designed the site, I bought a HTML template and applied it to the site backend. Currently, it looks amazing and gives me confidence and trust (I hope visitors think like that as well :^) ).

I also created a promotional video for the new site, but using code! I used Remotion and after understanding how it works, it became fun and efficient. Will definitely work on that as well for future use-cases. You can watch the video I made:
