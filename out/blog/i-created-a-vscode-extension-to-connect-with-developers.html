<h1>I created a VsCode extension to connect with developers!</h1>
<div>25.02.2021</div>

Yesterday, I released my most complicated extension to the VsCode marketplace. The core concept of **Codemate** is connecting with developers.

title2 What is used to create Codemate?

In VsCode to create a extension you have to use Javascript so I used Typescript to create the extension. But, to make the development simpler I also used <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte </a>to create user interfaces.

For the backend, I continued with Javscript so I created it with also Typescript. To store data I used most preferred choice, MongoDB.

Extension:

- Typescript
- Svelte

Backend / API:

- Typescript
- Express.js
- Github OAuth
- MongoDB

title2 What are the features?

I tried to keep it simple. Right now you can,

- customize your profile (don't forget to pick a programming language)
- connect with other people
- login with Github (it's more secure)
- completely<a href="https://github.com/berkaycubuk/codemate"> open source</a>

- Reaching out more people
