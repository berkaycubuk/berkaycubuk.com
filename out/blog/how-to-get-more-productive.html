<h1>How to get more productive</h1>
<p>date 03.02.2021</p>
<p>In today's world, getting distracted is super easy. Also, for a big chunk of young people, doing something is worthless. And I want to disagree with that. We're human because we can do whatever we want. We can build softwares, buildings, and new technologies. To move humanity forward, we have to do.</p>
<p>For myself, I'm currently a student (btw, I don't like university education ðŸ˜•), and because of the pandemic, we have online lessons. I don't have to go to school every day, and I don't have to go by bus with all the people on it. For me, things are going well, and I can code more, learn more and create more.</p>
<p>Ok, but how to create more?</p>
<p>Well, as I understood, you have to force yourself to create something every day. Currently, I'm writing on my blog every morning, and I feel better. I started to post more on my social media accounts, and they're not food or travel photos. I'm trying to showcase my work and create value for other people. As a result, I started to get more followers (you can check out the [contact](https://berkaycubuk.com/contact/) page to follow me ðŸ˜‰).</p>
<p>Try to find a place with productive people for me; I'm traveling around [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/), Twitter, and Instagram. For Twitter and Instagram, you have to limit yourself to specific people because a lot of people are just doing nothing, and your time is valuable, so be careful.</p>
<p>Also, don't care too much about what other people tell you. You know yourself better than anybody. Try new things to get more creative and be consistent.</p>
