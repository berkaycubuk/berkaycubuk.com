A lot of people want to start programming but usually, they don't know where to start. I would like to share my thoughts with you.

### **Python** 🐍

I know, it's become traditional but, it's true :) If you want to learn the basics about programming Python will help you. Also, if you want to learn how about **machine learning & neural network** stuff you also need to learn Python.

### **Javascript**

People are misunderstand this language, **it's not similar to Java**, they're different. 

Javascript first started for web applications and it's working on your browser not in the server. But today you can also run it on your server and that's super cool. That means you can create full stack web application with only Javascript.

It has popular frameworks like **React, Vue, Angular and Svelte**. But for beginners I suggest learning basic Javascript to understand things well. And then if you want to you can start learning frameworks.

### **PHP** 🐘

**PHP is server side programming language**, that means your code is running on server. PHP mainly used for web development and it's doing the job very well. You can use MySql for storing data and basic CRUD operations. It's super easy to learn and easy to create what you want.

Also, **Wordpress is created using PHP**, that's explain why it's used worldwide.

I started with PHP and now I'm playing around with mainly Javascript. But it doesn't matter what you choose, **you have to start doing something**.

Here are good resources to start learning programming:
