title About me

I'm a software engineer who enjoys technology.

I currently live in Turkey, and working as a Blockhain Engineer.

Fun fact about this site: I know it looks ugly, but the fun part is I built it using my own markup language called <a href="https://github.com/berkaycubuk/sophist" target="_blank">Sophist</a> :^)
